Unity Game Project - Against Time

Overview
This is a 3D game developed in Unity as part of a game development competition. The game features a unique visual style inspired by *Severance*, combined with a thrilling race-against-time maze challenge. Players must navigate through a dynamic and evolving environment to escape before time runs out.

Features
- First-Person Exploration: Navigate through an environment designed to challenge perception and reflexes.
- Race Against Time: Players must find the quickest route to escape before the clock runs out.
- Maze-Like Level Design: Inspired by *Severance*, players must traverse complex pathways with increasing difficulty.
- Atmospheric Visuals: Designed to evoke tension and urgency.
- Unity Engine: Built using Unity 3D with C# scripting.

Feasibility
Developing *Against Time* is a feasible project given the available resources and the team's skill set. The game mechanics, such as maze generation, time-based challenges, and environmental storytelling, can be implemented using Unity's built-in features. Procedural maze generation and AI-controlled obstacles may require additional research, but they are achievable within the development timeline. The project's visual style, inspired by *Severance*, can be realized through lighting, minimalistic textures, and an atmospheric soundtrack. However, due to technical difficulties, the team was only able to complete approximately 50% of the planned features. Future development could address these challenges and enhance the overall gameplay experience.

Real-World Applications
- Cognitive Skill Development: Enhances problem-solving, spatial awareness, and decision-making under pressure.
- Time Management Training: Encourages quick thinking and prioritization to achieve objectives efficiently.
- Game Design Innovation: Showcases procedural maze generation techniques that can be applied to various game genres.
- Educational Use: Can be adapted for learning-based applications involving navigation and logical reasoning.
